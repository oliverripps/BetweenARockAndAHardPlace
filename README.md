(since everyone was absent for the first day, we did the excerise where partners alternated between logic-ing out and typing the code)<br/>

Thursday 5/9<br/>
-Took a day off to study for the test....<br/>

Sunday 5/12<br/>
-Oliver and Geena facetimed and attempted to figure out this confusing lab. They worked specifically on color changing and creating different kinds of balls. <br/>
-Kenson and Jonah explained some confusing bit of the Rock code so that the Ball team could understand<br/>
-Oliver: Fixed a bug that crashed the lab upon collisions, worked on the mechanisms for the movements of the soccerball and basketball
         subclasses, added shapes to be attatched to the images of the balls, found out about tint andhelped Geena understand syntax
         and general flow of the code<br/>
-Geena: Created soccerball and basketball subclasses and re-arranged the hierarchy for the Ball class, fixed up isTouching, worked on
        the Collideable interface and other code related to making Collideable work, got tint to work and change colors upon hitting
        rocks (had to debug and fix this for a while)<br/>
